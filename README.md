# notet 1.1.6
Academic Research Tool

Program aims to simplify coding nodes in social sciences. You as a researcher or a student can use this program to make citations or take notes on a PDF source while reading it. If you are a programmer you can use techniques I've used to achieve whatever you want. notet works like NVivo program but not the whole thing just the coding nodes and tracking citations from sources are similar to NVivo.

Written with Python 3.7 and used eel and tkinter modules to create gui. tkinter is only used for get local files to Python, I tried to work with javascript for this operation it was so slow because of not getting absolute path from local pc.
